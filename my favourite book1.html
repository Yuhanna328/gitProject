    <h1>
        Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely
    </h1>
    <p>
        <!-- Summary section starts from here -->
        <strong>Summary:</strong> The book's main point is that people are not as rational as they think. We often make
        illogical decisions, but we do so in consistent, predictable patterns.
        <br>
        Author <em>Dan Ariely</em> uses simple and fun experiments to show how our choices are secretly influenced
        by things like emotions, context, and social norms, rather than pure logic. He reveals why we are drawn to
        "free" things, how we overvalue what we already own, and how the first price we see for something can stick
        in our minds and affect our future spending.

        <strong>Review:</strong> What I found most fascinating about "Predictably Irrational" was its eye-opening
        revelation that we are not the logical creatures we think we are. The book brilliantly shows how our decisions
        are constantly being hijacked by our emotions, instincts, and hidden social pressures. It makes you realize that
        the choices you make when you're calm and rational can be completely different from the ones you'd make when
        you're excited, anxious, or feeling the pull of temptation. It’s not just about big emotions either; it’s also
        about our ingrained desire to follow social norms and our constant struggle with procrastination.

        <strong> What I learned from this book:</strong> The most important thing I learned from "Predictably
        Irrational" is to be more aware and critical of my own mind. I learned to recognize the invisible forces that
        influence my daily choices, from the powerful allure of a "free" offer to the way my initial impressions can
        anchor my future decisions. It taught me that my gut feelings aren't always reliable and that my brain has
        predictable blind spots. On a practical level, I learned the importance of setting up systems to protect myself
        from my own irrationality, like creating rules to avoid making important decisions when I'm emotional, or
        setting my own deadlines to overcome procrastination.
